Project Name: Age Checker

Purpose:
This project helps me understand how Python makes decisions using if and else.

What the program does:
The program asks the user for their age and checks if they are old enough to be granted access.

What I learned:
- How to use input() in Python
- How to convert input to numbers
- How to use if and else statements

Next steps:
I want to improve this by adding more conditions.
